Hello friend.
While the whole world is in lockdown and facing quarantine,  
I have finally decided to start something I have always in my mind.  

Daily or during my work process I generate a lot of questions about tech things I find new for me or about areas I do not understand enough. Each time my search leads me to new areas and concepts.
Knowledge I gain and information I go through while browsing numerous   sources to fulfill my interests sometimes are too much, hence are hard to   remember and easy to forget. Therefore, I am kicking off this blog, hopefully it will help me analyze my constant stream of information.
